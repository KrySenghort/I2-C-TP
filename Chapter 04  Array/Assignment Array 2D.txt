welcome to 2D array homework:
Program 1.Consider you have the following progragram: 
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i, j, val[3][4] = {8,16,9,52,3,15,27,6,14,25,2,10};
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)
            printf("%d    ", val[i][j] );
    return 0;
}


Program 2.  Write a program that adds the values of all elements inthe val array used in Program 1 and displays the total.


Program 3.  Modify the program written for Program 2 to display the total of each row separately.


program 4.  Write a C program that adds equivalent elements of the twodimensional
arrays named first and second. Both arrays should have two rows and three columns.

For example, element [1][2] of the resulting array should be the sum of first[1][2]
and second[1][2]. The first and second arrays should be initialized as follows:
    first             second
16   18   23        24   52   77
54   91   11        16   19   59
